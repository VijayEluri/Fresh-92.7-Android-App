==Prerequisites==
1. Android SDK (with platform v15)
2. Apache Maven
3. Eclipse (not strictly mandatory)

==How to get started==
1. Clone the repo to your machine
2. Open a terminal/command prompt to the 'Fresh 92.7' directory
3. Run this maven command to generate the eclipse project files: mvn eclipse:eclipse -Dandroid.sdk.path=<path to your android sdk>
4. This will take a few minutes the first time you run it as it needs to download a few dependencies. Once it's done, it should say BUILD SUCCESSFUL at the end, you can fire up eclipse
5. Import the project into eclipse using the 'Existing project into workspace' option
6. Start hacking away
